# VBA-CHALLENGE

I am  using  VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.
A script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

1.The ticker symbol

2.Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

3.The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

4.The total stock volume of the stock. 

Retrieval of Data:
The script loops through one year of stock data and reads/ stores all of the following values from each row:

1.ticker symbol 

2.volume of stock 

3.open price 

4.close price 

All three of the following values are calculated correctly and displayed in the output:

1.Greatest % Increase 

2.Greatest % Decrease 

3.Greatest Total Volume 

Conditional formatting is applied correctly and appropriately to the yearly change column conditional formatting is applied correctly and appropriately to the percent change column
